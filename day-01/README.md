# Day 1 Grandpa's Gift List

## Challenge

Grandpa has a Christmas wish list to keep track of all the gifts he wants to ask for. But thereâ€™s a problem: if he forgets heâ€™s already added something, the list gets clogged up with duplicates. This happened last year, and he ended up with 8 talking picture frames on Christmas Day!

Your task is to complete the `checkDuplicate()` function ðŸ‘‡ to ensure no duplicates are added to the list. But hereâ€™s the tricky part: Grandpa sometimes hits the spacebar more than once, making it harder to spot duplicates.

For example, only one of these entries should be added to the list â€” the others should be flagged as duplicates:

```js
"talking picture frames";
"talking  picture frames";
"talking picture    frames";
" talking picture frames ";
```

**Your tasks:**

1. Ensure no duplicates can be added to the list.
2. Account for extra spaces at the beginning/end and between words.

**Stretch Goals:**

1. Case Sensitivity: Handle cases where capitalization differs. For example:

   - `"Cat Hammock"` should be flagged as a duplicate of `"cat hammock"`.
   - Preserve Grandpaâ€™s original capitalization (e.g., if `"Cat Hammock"` is added first, that should be added to the list). Do not simply convert all entries to lower case - Grandpa might well want to capitalize some words.

2. Additional Features: Add functionality to delete or edit items on the list.
